Welcome to the game of Risk!  This is
a turn based game. Each turn a player
is given troops to deploy on the board.
After deployment the player can then
attack neighbouring opponents and claim 
more land to get more troops. After all
attacks are done the player can move to 
adjacent countries to strengthen their
defences.
 
ProTip: claiming a whole continent gives 
the player bonus troops!
